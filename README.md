WARNING: This is a very naive attempt at implementing C++ templates in C. Use at your own risk

This program is an implementation of C++ templates in C. It is written for the fellow programmers who want to speed up development with the generics of C++ but want to stick with the simplicity and speed of C (like me). This is not meant to be a replacement for the C++ template system; this is just an alternative to it for C. A lot of work is being put into developing this project. As of right now, this project is complete. Possible fixes are more efficient memory usage, better lexing, maybe not construct a hash table if only one template is there, and error logging (program just crashes if there is an error in syntax).
