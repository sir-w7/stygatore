Basically, Stygatore is a metaprogramming tool aiming at language-agnostic code generation for generics programming. Nothing more, nothing less. The code is kept as simple as possible to achieve this goal, while performance and memory usage are key considerations while programming. It is a clean, maintainable, performant, and minimal codebase.
